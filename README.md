HandleExceptionsWithPolicies
============================

Policies are very powerful tool. They allow to decouple exception handling from the main code. This leads to smaller and simpler classes which adhere to Single Responsibility principle. By using a strategy pattern we also follow Open/Closed principle and make the application easy to extend. Policies are easy to reuse, hence it is easier to prevent code duplication (DRY principle).

This is a sample code for article "Using policies to handle exceptions while calling external services" (<a href="https://mariuszwojcik.wordpress.com">link</a>) which shows how policies can be used to handle exceptions.
